            "sh": "A Short Hop, or a SH, is performed in 2 ways in SSBU:\n\n1) Pushing the jump button, then releasing it before becoming airborne\n2) Buffering an aerial during the jump startup\n\nA SH is a shorter version of a normal jump, allowing you to hit grounded opponents and land quicker.\n\nAfter performing a SH in SSBU, your aerial damage will be reduced to 0.85x its original damage. This applies until you jump or touch the ground. It is currently unknown if this applies to specials. It is also unknown if hitting an aerial, performing a special, performing an aerial, or being hit resets this.",
            "faf": "FAF is the First Actionable Frame. It's basically the first frame you can perform an action during another one. For instance, if a move has a FAF of 24, the first frame you can act during it is frame 24, and the last frame you cannot act is frame 23.",

Each Smashcord does it differently - some structure theirs on a schedule and some don't, some end theirs with a crew battle and some don't, etc.",
            "oos": "OoS refers to your Out of Shield options, or the things you can do while shielding. These are, for any character:\n\n- Grab\n-Jump\n- JC USmash\n- JC Up Special\n- Any special used after a jump\n- Any aerial after a jump\n- Airdodge after a jump\n- Any move after a shield drop. See also: JC",
            "rar": "RAR stands for Reverse Aerial Rush. It is performed by running in one direction, then holding behind you so that you skid while facing the opposite direction. Because you can cancel this animation with a jump, you can then jump and perform aerials. This allows you to approach with a Back Air or retreat with a Forward Air, etc.",
            "rar2": "RAR stands for Reverse Aerial Rush. It's a technique that exploits how the skid animation works; you can jump during a skid, allowing you to jump out of a dash facing the opposite direction you started. This is notably useful for moving forward using a Back Aerial.",

For instance, in Smash 4, Little Mac's Jab 1 is Frame 1, which is instant. Mario's Jab 1 is Frame 2, which is almost instant, etc. The speed of a move is often abbreviated to Fx, where x is the frame the move comes out on. For example, Little Mac's Jab would be F1 and Mario's would be F2.",

            "fh": "A Full Hop, or a FH, is the normal type of jump. It is performed when you do not buffer an aerial on your jump startup or you hold the jump button throughout your jump startup. Using a FH allows you to hit opponents on high platforms, hit opponents far above you, followup from certain moves, etc.",
            "aa": "An AA is an anti-air, and it's basically a move that counters an aerial approach. It is typically disjointed and/or has a high hitbox. A traditional fighting game example is Ryu's Heavy Kick or Shoryuken in Street Fighter. A Smash Bros example is Cloud's Cross Slash.",
            "rage": "Rage is a mechanic that increases the knockback dealt slightly by a fighter as their percent increases. It starts taking effect at 35% and gradually became stronger, maxing at 150%. It does not affect moves with WBKB (weight based knockback). See also: wbkb",

            "sdi": "SDI is short for Smash Directional-Influence (oficially called hitstun shuffling). It is NOT DI (Directional Influence) and is a completely different mechanic. It is performed while pressing a direction repeatedly while in hitlag (also known as freeze frames). Each time you press a direction, you will move slightly in that direction **before** knockback. This allows you to escape multihit moves, such as rapid jabs.\n\nA more effective method in Smash 4 on the Gamecube Controller was to push the control stick to the notch of the direction you wanted to SDI in, then move it to the 2 notches beside it. For instance if you wanted to SDI up, you would do an input like this:\n\n⬆ ↖ ⬆ ↗ ⬆ \n\nIt is unknown if this is the most effective SDI method in SSBU.",

            "zac": " A Z-drop Aerial Catch or ZAC, is performed by pressing grab while in the air to z-drop an item (like bombs), and then immediately inputting an aerial, which will recatch the bomb. The result will be a somewhat delayed aerial while holding a bomb. This can allow for some more unique combo potential.",

            "ac": "An Autocancel is where a move can land with zero endlag. Most moves have an aucocancel window before the move comes out, and after the move has completed. If you land during this period, you will land without lag. Example: Link dair from very high up can land with no endlag, but if you try to dair close to the ground you will have a noticable amount of lag.",
            "b reverse": "A B-reverse happens when you do a Special move (such as side-B), and then immediately press the control stick in the opposite direction that you are facing. This will shift all your momentum from the original direction of travel into the new direction. Not all special moves can do this and get the momentum shift. See also: wavebounce, turnaroundspecial",
            "turnaround special": "A Turnaround Special is performed by  pressing left or right before initiating a special move. This will result in a special move facing the new direction, with no shift in momentum. See also: breverse, wavebounce",
            "wavebounce": "A Wavebounce combines the effects of a B-Reverse and a Turnaround Special. If you move to the right, for example, and do a turnaround Shorthop Lucas PK Fire to the left, but immediately input to the right after inputting the special, you will end up 'bouncing' back to the left, while shooting right. The inputs for this are jump to the right > left special > right. The timing for this is precise, and requires practice to perform reliably. See also: breverse, turnaroundspecial",

            "waveland": "A Waveland is where you airdodge down into a platform or the ground to land more quickly. The name is related to a wavedash, as both can end with you sliding on the ground.",
            "jc": "A Jump Cancel, or JS, is commonly used to refer to when you jump and then cancel that jump into something else before you leave the ground. During Jumpsquat (JS), you can input an Up Special, Up Smash, or Item Toss, and it will cancel your jump into that action. Some techs like JC item toss have, in previous games, caused you to slide while tossing. JC Usmash is how you do an Usmash OOS, and JC UpB is how you can do an UpB OOS, since you can jump straight out of shielding. See also: OOS, JS",
            "js": "Jumpsquat, or JS, is the animation that you go into where you are essentially squatting before you leave the ground during a jump. When you input a jump, your character will squat for 3 frames (in ultimate). After 3 frames you will then leave the ground, after which point you are no longer able to Jump Cancel (JC). See also: JC",
            "bkb": "Base Knockback, or BKB for short, is the baseline knockback for a move. BKB is generally the only form of knockback seen when the opponent is hit at 0%. High BKB means that the move can knock the opponent far even at a low percent, like Marth tippers or Ganon's Warlock Punch. Low BKB has very little starting knockback, like Shiek's Fair or Most characters' Jab 1. See: kb, wbkb, kbg",
            "kbg": "Knockback Growth, or KBG, is how much knockback strength grows as the opponent takes more and more damage. High KBG means that the move will knock opponents farther sooner like most smashes. Low KBG means that the move will kill later or has a more consistant knockback, like Shiek's Fair or Mario's Utilt pre-nerf. See also: bkb, wbkb, kb",
            "di": "DI, short for Directional Influence, is a mechanic that allows you to slightly change your launch angle. This is performed by pushing the control stick perpendicular to your launch angle, and will shift it in the direction you push. In Smash 4, you could change your angle by about 9.7 degrees. DIing towards someone is usually referred to as \"DI in\" and DIing away from someone is usually referred to as \"DI out\". There are two major applications for DI- combo DI and survival DI\n\nKeep in mind there is a second mechanic you must use in conjunction with DI known as LSI. See also - Combo DI, Survival DI, LSI",
            "combo di": "Combo DI allows you to escape combos by changing your launch angle in a way that you get hit farther from the opponent. For instance, when DK uses an aerial cargo up throw, you can DI it towards him. This will place you farther from him than you would normally be, making it harder for him to connect an up air. See also - DI, Survival DI, LSI",
            "survival di": "Survival DI allows you to survive kill moves by changing your launch angle in a way that makes you take more time to reach the blast zones. For instance, against Mewtwo's up throw, you can DI away from him to survive longer. See also - DI, Combo DI, LSI",
            "lsi": "LSI, short for Launch Speed Influence, is a mechanic that allows you to change the speed you are launched at. It only applies if the launch angle is between 65 and 295 degrees. The method to perform it is simple- hold up to fly faster, hold down to fly slower! However, its applications are much more complicated. This comes from the fact that you can use both DI and LSI at the same time. This matters because *DIing down is not good* in most situations. There's 2 reasons for this: 1) DIing down makes it harder to recover, because you have less time to drift and 2) it makes you reach the blast zone quicker.\n\nTo avoid this problem, you must find the angle that takes advantage of both good DI and good LSI. On more horizontal moves, this is usually simply in, which only takes advantage of DI. On diagonal launch angles, however, this is usually down and in. The down part is for LSI, the in part is for DI. Breaking it down further, the down input slows your momentum and the in part makes you take longer to reach the blast zone.\n\nThere is another mechanic related to LSI that makes certain moves kill at much later percents- LSI is applied after DI. This means if a move launches you outside of the LSI range originally (i.e. at 70 degrees) and you DI it into the LSI range, you can also begin to LSI it. For example, Charizard's Smash 4 UThrow had an angle of 70 degrees and you could hold down and away to remove most of its kill potential. Not only is this angle perfect to bring it into LSI range, but it also DIs the *vertical* half of it, by DIing away from Charizard as well.\n\nFinally, if you played Melee, you will know the optimal survival DI for diagonal or horizontal moves was up. In SSBU, **this will kill you. Do not do it.** While this angle is the correct *DI*, it is the incorrect *LSI*. In this situation, LSI takes more effect, and you die sooner. Make sure whenever you DI something, your DI \"agrees\" with your LSI. See also - DI"

This can be useful for a number of reasons. Our relatively short bomb timer can remain as a threat to players who are not actively keeping up with its explosion timer.
