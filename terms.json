            "di": "DI, short for __D__irectional __I__nfluence, is a mechanic that allows you to slightly change your launch angle. This is performed by pushing the control stick perpendicular to your launch angle, and will shift it in the direction you push. In Smash 4, you could change your angle by about 9.7 degrees. DIing towards someone is usually referred to as \"DI in\" and DIing away from someone is usually referred to as \"DI out\". There are two major applications for DI- combo DI and survival DI\n\nKeep in mind there is a second mechanic you must use in conjunction with DI known as LSI. See also - Combo DI, Survival DI, LSI",
            "combo di": "Combo DI allows you to escape combos by changing your launch angle in a way that you get hit farther from the opponent. For instance, when DK uses an aerial cargo up throw, you can DI it towards him. This will place you farther from him than you would normally be, making it harder for him to connect an up air. See also - DI, Survival DI, LSI",
            "survival di": "Survival DI allows you to survive kill moves by changing your launch angle in a way that makes you take more time to reach the blast zones. For instance, against Mewtwo's up throw, you can DI away from him to survive longer. See also - DI, Combo DI, LSI",
            "lsi": "LSI, short for __L__aunch __S__peed __I__nfluence, is a mechanic that allows you to change the speed you are launched at. It only applies if the launch angle is between 65 and 295 degrees. The method to perform it is simple- hold up to fly faster, hold down to fly slower! However, its applications are much more complicated. This comes from the fact that you can use both DI and LSI at the same time. This matters because *DIing down is not good* in most situations. There's 2 reasons for this: 1) DIing down makes it harder to recover, because you have less time to drift and 2) it makes you reach the blast zone quicker.\n\nTo avoid this problem, you must find the angle that takes advantage of both good DI and good LSI. On more horizontal moves, this is usually simply in, which only takes advantage of DI. On diagonal launch angles, however, this is usually down and in. The down part is for LSI, the in part is for DI. Breaking it down further, the down input slows your momentum and the in part makes you take longer to reach the blast zone.\n\nThere is another mechanic related to LSI that makes certain moves kill at much later percents- LSI is applied after DI. This means if a move launches you outside of the LSI range originally (i.e. at 70 degrees) and you DI it into the LSI range, you can also begin to LSI it. For example, Charizard's Smash 4 UThrow had an angle of 70 degrees and you could hold down and away to remove most of its kill potential. Not only is this angle perfect to bring it into LSI range, but it also DIs the *vertical* half of it, by DIing away from Charizard as well.\n\nFinally, if you played Melee, you will know the optimal survival DI for diagonal or horizontal moves was up. In SSBU, **this will kill you. Do not do it.** While this angle is the correct *DI*, it is the incorrect *LSI*. In this situation, LSI takes more effect, and you die sooner. Make sure whenever you DI something, your DI \"agrees\" with your LSI. See also - DI",

Teching into the ground while holding down lets you tech in place, and holding forwards or backwards lets you perform a tech roll. Tech rolls vary in length and speed between characters, and some may be faster/slower or cover more/less distance than a regular roll.\n\nTeching into a wall is known as a wall tech. Teching into a wall normally will cancel momentum and cause you to drop down, holding away after teching allows you to perform a tech wall jump, and holding in will allow you to cling to the wall immediately after teching (character dependant).\n\nLastly is ceiling techs, which allow you cancel momentum off of a ceiling.

If done correctly, Popo will perform the move and Nana will perform a short dash forward.\n\nTechnical details: Just like with other run turn desynchs, you have to input the move before Nana goes into turn so that she interprets the turn input as a dash forward. Out of skid, dash interrupts as early as frame 8. So you have to skid, turn, and then input a move at least 8 frames after the original skid, but less than 6 frames after the turn",

We are the saviors of my life.\nSo be it, until there is no enemy, but peace. Amen.",

            "nanatrump": "While trumping is only mediocre for a lot of characters in this game, since the opponent can DI in or away from the stage and limit your options for directly punishing it, Ice Climbers has what is likely the best trump punishes in the game. The answer is to make nana trump the opponent, while immdiately hitting ledge with popo fsmash. This is called nanatrump.\nThere are two main ways to do this - \n1. Run towards ledge and pivot grab towards center stage right before you reach ledge. While popo is in the endlag from the pivot grab, you can trump with nana.\n2. You can jump towards ledge, and if you space your landing just right, nana will grab ledge but popo will land on stage.\n\nAs nana trumps the opponent, you must immediately fsmash the ledge with popo. If done properly, they will get hit by the fsmash immediately after breaking contact with the ledge, which guarantees the fsmash.\nExample: https://twitter.com/bigd_ssb/status/1086753626670809088",
            "dashgrab dashthrough": "[OBSOLETE, REMOVED AS OF 3.0] If you initiate a dash, then wait 6 frames for nana to initiate her dash, and then grab an opponent during nana's initial dash animation, and continue to hold forward, nana will keep running (foxtrotting technically) forward  past popo until she is out of control range. Very similar to semisync, and technically this sets up a cheerless, though its uses are more limited. Near ledge, you can have nana walk to the ledge, which can set up a teeter cancel, if you are precise. Otherwise, you can have nana grab ledge, and then do the following - https://gfycat.com/marvelousobesecranefly",
